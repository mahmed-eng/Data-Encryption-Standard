# Data Encryption Standard (DES) Algorithm

![DES Algorithm](des_algorithm.jpg)

## Introduction

DES (Data Encryption Standard) is a symmetric-key block cipher algorithm that was developed in the early 1970s at IBM and adopted by the U.S. government as a federal standard for encryption. Despite its age, DES has been widely used in various applications and serves as a fundamental building block for many cryptographic protocols.

This repository provides a simple implementation of the DES algorithm in [programming language], intended for educational purposes.
